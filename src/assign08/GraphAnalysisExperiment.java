	//Design and conduct an experiment to compare BFS to DFS performance. 
	//We recommend using random mazes that are at least 50x50 with 30% wall density and 5 goals 
	//(see the provided random maze generator). 
	//On average, does DFS or BFS require searching more nodes before finding a goal? 
	//You do not need to take thousands of samples like in previous analysis assignments, but you should use at least 10 random mazes.
