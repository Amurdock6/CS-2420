Steps:
1. Scan File.
2. During the Scan check for the sentence we need to complete and store values that need to be replaced.
3. Find the the terminal values we need to complete the list.
4. Find any terminal values we need to fill in the rest of the values.
5. Create a finished sentence with the coresponding values we have found and genreate as many of these as the args[1] pramater tells us too. 


Need to Do:
-We need to find away to store the sentence and decied what items in the sentence need to be replaced and what they need to be replaced with.

-We need to make a method that will create a new HashMap when we need to store terminal values for a given non-terminal.

-We need to find away to replace non-terminals with the appropiate replacement terminal in the sentence:
	Idea1: We should make sometype of datastructe that is quick to add and look up items for each non-terminal we have in the sentence and then store the coresponding terminals in that datastructure. 


Helpful Things I have found out:
-We can tell if a non-terminal is a source to take terminals from and add to the sentence if it is on a line all by its self.

-We can only take terminals under each non-terminal source if there is not a non-terminal contained in that line also.
	exe: <a> exampleBad <-- is not a terminal we can use
		 exampleGood <-- is a terminal we can use
